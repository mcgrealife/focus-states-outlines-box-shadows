# focus-states-outlines-box-shadows

[Edit in StackBlitz next generation editor ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/~/github.com/mcgrealife/focus-states-outlines-box-shadows)


Stackblitz vanilla projects do not seem to ship with a dev server
I added a recommended extension of 'Live server'
When VScode prompts you, install it in this web container
In the bottom right of the browser vscode instance, click 'live server'
This will start dev server and show the UI in the browser panel

But, it might be easier to simply view it in the old stackblitz (non web container) – which includes a dev server and preview without extra setup
